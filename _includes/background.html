      I'm currently a Student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt University</a> in the
      School of Engineering studying Computer Science and Engineering Management. Last year, I completed a 6 month Co-Op
      at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.kohlercompany.com/" target="_blank">Kohler Co.</a>, working within the
      IT Department on the Agile Project Management team.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical
      knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are
      scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably playing video games, spending time with
      family,
      or painting.
